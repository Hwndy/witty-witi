   - Added support for user field in different formats
   - Improved error handling and toast notifications

### Backend Changes

   - Enhanced product ID extraction from various sources
   - Added product lookup by name when ID is missing
   - Improved validation and error messages

2. **Added CORS Configuration**
   - Created dedicated CORS middleware
   - Added support for all frontend origins
   - Configured proper headers and methods

3. **Created Deployment Script**
   - Added script to automatically apply all fixes
   - Includes checks for existing files
   - Provides clear instructions for manual steps

## Implementation Instructions

### Frontend Repository

1. **Update API Functions**
   - The `index.ts` file in the `api` folder has been updated to use actual API calls
   - All order-related functions now try the real API first and fall back to mock data if needed

2. **Update CheckoutPage Component**
   - The `CheckoutPage.tsx` file has been updated to format order items correctly
   - Order items now include all necessary fields including images

3. **Update OrderStore**
   - The `orderStore.ts` file has been updated to handle different ID formats
   - Added support for user field in different formats

### Backend Repository

1. **Apply Order Controller Fixes**
   - Copy the `orderController.fixed.js` file to replace `orderController.js`
   - This controller handles different item formats and improves validation

2. **Add CORS Configuration**
   - Ensure the `cors.js` file is in the `middleware` folder
   - Update your server file to use this middleware

3. **Run the Deployment Script**
   - Execute `node deploy-order-fixes.js` to automatically apply all fixes
   - This script will update the necessary files and provide next steps

## Testing

After implementing these changes, test the order system by:

1. **Creating an Order**
   - Add products to the cart
   - Complete the checkout process
   - Verify the order is created successfully

2. **Viewing Orders**
   - Check the orders page to see if orders are displayed correctly
   - Verify order details are complete and accurate

3. **Managing Orders**
   - Test updating order status
   - Test cancelling an order
   - Verify changes are reflected correctly

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues after implementing these fixes:

1. **Check Console Logs**
   - Both frontend and backend have detailed logging
   - Look for specific error messages

2. **Verify API Responses**
   - Use browser developer tools to inspect network requests
   - Check response status codes and data

3. **Check CORS Headers**
   - Ensure CORS headers are being sent correctly
   - Verify the origin is in the allowed list
